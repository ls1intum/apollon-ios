### Import and Export
Apollon iOS allows importing JSON files for diagrams created on [Apollon Standalone](https://apollon.ase.cit.tum.de) or from other users. Diagrams created and edited on the Apollon iOS application can also be exported to JSON, PNG, and PDF, allowing you to share and save your diagrams easily.

### UML Diagram Types
Currently, Apollon iOS supports creating multiple UML diagrams, with more types to be added.

The list of UML diagram types includes:
-   `Class Diagram`
-   `Object Diagram`
-   `Activity Diagram`
-   `Use Case Diagram`
-   `Component Diagram`

## Technical
The app was created as a native iOS implementation of the [Apollon Standalone](https://apollon.ase.cit.tum.de). We employ the MVVM design pattern as the general architectural pattern. The main modeling functionality is imported from the [Apollon-iOS-Module](https://github.com/ls1intum/apollon-ios-module) SPM package and utilizes the `ApollonEdit` module to enable users to create, modify, and interact with UML diagrams. The previews on the home screen utilize the `ApollonView` module to allow users to see a preview of their diagram. Further, the diagrams are saved locally on the device using SwiftData, so no internet connection is needed.
